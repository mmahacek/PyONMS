= Cloud Portal

The OpenNMS Cloud Portal provides management capabilities for hosted services.
A library for accessing the Cloud Portal API is included along site the {page-component-title} library.

== Getting started

A `test_portal.py` file is provided as an example of interacting with the library.

Define the following environment variable to store your API key for connecting to the cloud API.

* `portal_secret`

NOTE: The portal endpoints are still in development, therefore documentation is limited.
