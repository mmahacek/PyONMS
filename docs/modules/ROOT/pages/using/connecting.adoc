= Connecting To A Server

The {page-component-title} library works by defining an instance and then making calls against the various endpoints.

.Define a server instance
[source, python]
----
from pyonms import PyONMS

my_server = PyONMS(
    hostname='http://localhost:8980/opennms',<1>
    username='admin',<2>
    password='admin',
)
----
<1> Replace with the hostname to your instance.
<2> Ensure the credentials provided have at least `ROLE_REST`.

== Performing endpoint actions

From your server instance object, endpoints can be utilized as class attributes of the server instance.

.Example call to retrieve nodes for the instance
[source, python]
----
nodes = my_server.nodes.get_nodes()
----

NOTE: Due to the early stage of this library, full documentation is not available for the various endpoints.
This library does use type hinting, so your IDE should provide information regarding the inputs and results for the various methods.
