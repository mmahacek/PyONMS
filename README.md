# PyONMS

A Python library for accessing the OpenNMS REST API.

This is being developed with Python 3.10 and OpenNMS 30.

- [OpenNMS API documentation](https://docs.opennms.com/horizon/30/development/rest/rest-api.html)

## Information

This is currently an early, pre-alpha version of this library.  More details will be added as I figure out what they are.

## Getting Started

- Copy `config.py.example` to `config.py` and update it with your OpenNMS server connection information.
- Copy `test_example.py` to `test.py` and this file is an example of using the API, and how I've been testing as I go along.
