# PyONMS

A Python library for accessing the OpenNMS REST API.

This is being developed with Python 3.10 and OpenNMS 30.
It may work on older versions, but they haven't been tested yet.

- [OpenNMS REST API documentation](https://docs.opennms.com/horizon/30/development/rest/rest-api.html)

## Information

This is currently an early, pre-alpha version of this library.
More details will be added as I figure out what they are.


## Endpoints Supported

Currently the endpoints (partially) supported are:

* Alarms (read-only)
* Business Services (read-write)
* Events (read-only)
* Foreign Sources (read-only)
* Heath (read-only)
* Info (read-only)
* Nodes (read-only)
* Requisitions (read-only)

## Getting Started

See the [project documentation](https://mmahacek.github.io/PyONMS/) for instructions on using this library.
